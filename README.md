Firefox add-on to work with iframe and frame tags:

- Indicate if the current web page uses iframe and frame tags by changing the colour of the add-on icon.
- Scroll the window to the elements with tags and highlight them with a red border.
- Redirection. A list of sites where the add-on will apply a redirection automatically to the first iframe/frame source can be configured.
