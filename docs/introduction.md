# Check Iframe

## Introduction

Thank you for using this add-on!

This is a Firefox add-on to work with iframe and frame tags:

- Indicate if the current web page uses iframe and frame tags by changing the colour of the add-on icon.
- Scroll the window to the elements with tags and highlight them with a red border.
- Redirection. A list of sites where the addon will apply a redirection automatically to the first iframe/frame source can be configured.

Click on the add-on icon to work with a pop-up window that gives you details and allows you to configure the add-on.

### Add-on notifications

Set the mouse over the icon to see a description of the result.

The meaning of the icon's colours is: 

- Gray icon: the website cannot be checked.
- Green icon: no tag iframe or frame detected.
- Orange icon: tag detected.
- Purple icon: tag detected and at least one source matches with any term in the configured user's list of special sources to notify.
