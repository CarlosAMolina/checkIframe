# Blacklisted URLs

## Introduction

This option creates and modifies a blacklist of sources that should not be listed in the message shown when the `Show tags info` button is clicked, these sources won't be bordered neither.

These sources will be taken into account when changing the add-on's icon colour to notify something has been detected.

## Configuration

Only URLs that match exactly what you specified will be blacklisted. For example, to blacklist the source `https://duckduckgo.com/post3.html`, you must configure the whole URL, not only a part like `https://duckduckgo.com/`.

The steps to add a new blacklisted source are:

1. Click the `Configuration` button to open the configuration menu.
2. Below `Sources options`, select the `Sources to omit (exact match)` option.
3. Save new sources, you can write them in two ways:
    - One by one

      Write the source in the input box below `New values` and click the `Add` button or press enter in the keyboard.

    - Multiple sources

      You can write more than one source, each one must be in a different line.

    The saved sources will appear below the input box.

4. Edit saved sources

    You can edit them by clicking over each saved rule and modify the values.
